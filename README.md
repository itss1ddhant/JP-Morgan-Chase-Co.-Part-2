# JP-Morgan-Chase-Co.-Part-2

This is he repository for the second task at JPMC SE Intern 
The task involved following responsibility.
Using JP Morgan Chase framework "PERSPECTIVE" & tools:-
Fixed the client-side web application so that it displays a graph that automatically updates as it gets data from the server application instead of requiring repeated updation manually. Generated a git patch for the same.

As usual, the setting up and further helpful guides will be updated with time.
Have fun exploring!
